  'India''s Best DPDP Consent Manager: A Comparison of Consently.in vs. OneTrust, Privy, GoTrust & Others',

  'Looking for the best DPDPA 2023 consent manager? We compare Consently.in against Global giants like OneTrust and Indian alternatives like Privy and GoTrust to help you decide.',
  '<h2>The New Reality: DPDPA 2023 is Here</h2>
<p>With the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023 now a reality, Indian businesses are scrambling to fix one broken link in their tech stack: The Consent Manager.</p>
<p>For years, Indian companies relied on "cookie banners" designed for Europe''s GDPR. But India''s DPDP Act is different. It demands support for 22 Schedule 8 languages, strict grievance redressal mechanisms, and "Consent Artifacts" that prove you have the right to process data.</p>
<p>The market is flooded with options—some are global giants, and some are new Indian entrants. Today, we compare Consently.in against the field: GoTrust, Consentin, OneTrust, Privy, Privasapien, and Securiti.ai.</p>

<h2>1. The Global Giants: OneTrust & Securiti.ai</h2>
<p>OneTrust and Securiti.ai are the heavyweights of the privacy world. They are powerful, feature-rich, and designed for Fortune 500 companies with massive legal teams.</p>

<h3>The Good</h3>
<p>They cover every regulation on earth (GDPR, CCPA, LGPD, etc.). If you are a multinational corporation with offices in 20 countries, they are a safe bet.</p>

<h3>The Bad</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Implementation can take months. They are often "over-engineered" for businesses that just need DPDPA compliance.</li>
  <li><strong>Pricing:</strong> Their pricing models are often opaque and expensive (thousands of dollars/month), usually out of reach for Indian startups and SMEs.</li>
  <li><strong>India Context:</strong> While they are adapting, their core architecture is Western-centric. Support for regional Indian languages often feels like an afterthought.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. The Indian Competitors: Privy, GoTrust, Consentin & Privasapien</h2>
<p>As the DPDP Act emerged, several Indian players entered the ring.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Privy (by IDfy):</strong> A strong contender backed by IDfy''s identity verification tech. It''s great for "Privacy by Design" but can be overkill if you just need a clean Consent Manager.</li>
  <li><strong>GoTrust:</strong> Focuses heavily on the 72-hour breach notification and automation. Good for technical compliance but less focused on the user experience of the consent banner itself.</li>
  <li><strong>Privasapien:</strong> This is a "Privacy Engineering" platform. It''s excellent for risk assessment and data anonymity but is more of a developer/data-scientist tool than a marketing/legal consent solution.</li>
  <li><strong>Consentin (by Leegality):</strong> Strong on the legal documentation side (thanks to Leegality''s background) but focuses heavily on BFSI (banking/finance) workflows rather than general web/app consent.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Consently.in is the Best Choice for Indian Business</h2>
<p>While the competitors focus on enterprise complexity or GDPR-clones, Consently.in was built with a single mission: To be the operating system for India''s DPDP Act.</p>
<p>Here is why Consently stands out as the winner:</p>

<h3>1. Truly "Built for Bharat" (22 Languages)</h3>
<p>The DPDP Act mandates that consent requests must be available in the user''s native language. Most tools use auto-translate APIs that break the UI.</p>
<p>Consently.in supports all 22 Schedule 8 Indian languages natively. Whether your user speaks Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, or Hindi, your consent banner will look perfect and legally compliant.</p>

<h3>2. Pricing That Makes Sense (₹0.01 per Consent)</h3>
<p>Competitors often lock you into expensive monthly retainers ($500+).</p>
<p>Consently.in disrupts this with a usage-based model. You pay virtually nothing to start. Our pricing is transparent: ₹0.01 per consent recorded. You only pay when you grow.</p>

<h3>3. Setup in Minutes, Not Months</h3>
<p>You don''t need a certification to use Consently.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>GoTrust/OneTrust:</strong> Requires sales calls, onboarding sessions, and developer integration.</li>
  <li><strong>Consently.in:</strong> Sign up, copy a single line of Javascript code, and your site is compliant. It detects cookies automatically and categorizes them instantly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. The "Consent Artifact" Engine</h3>
<p>Under DPDPA, if a user complains, the burden of proof is on you. Consently generates a tamper-proof Consent Artifact for every user interaction—logging the timestamp, IP, language displayed, and exact text agreed to. This is your "Get Out of Jail Free" card during audits.</p>

<h2>Final Verdict</h2>
<p>If you are a bank with a global presence, OneTrust might still be your choice. If you are a deep-tech AI firm needing data anonymization, Privasapien is great.</p>
<p>But for 99% of Indian businesses—SaaS platforms, E-commerce stores, Fintechs, and Startups—who need to comply with DPDPA 2023 quickly, affordably, and accurately, <strong>Consently.in is the undisputed choice.</strong></p>
<p>Don''t wait for the fines to start.</p>
