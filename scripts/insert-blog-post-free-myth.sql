  'Most "Free" DPDPA consent managers have hidden limits—capped pageviews, missing languages, and no audit logs. Here is why Consently.in''s usage-based model is the transparent alternative you need.',
  '<h2>"Free" Always Comes with a Price Tag</h2>
<p>If you search for "Free DPDPA Consent Manager," you will find plenty of options. Global players like CookieYes, OneTrust, and Termly all offer "Free Forever" plans.</p>
<p>For a bootstrapped startup or a developer, this sounds perfect. You sign up, paste the code, and forget about it.</p>
<p>But here is the trap: These free tiers are designed to break as soon as you grow. They are not built for compliance; they are built for upselling.</p>

<h2>The 3 Hidden Traps of "Free" Consent Managers</h2>

<h3>1. The Pageview Trap</h3>
<p>Most free plans have strict traffic limits.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Competitor A:</strong> Free up to 25,000 pageviews/month.</li>
  <li><strong>Competitor B:</strong> Free up to 5,000 sessions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Reality:</strong> One viral reel or a successful product launch, and your banner disappears overnight. Suddenly, you are non-compliant exactly when you have the most eyes on you. To turn it back on, you are forced into a $20–$50/month subscription.</p>

<h3>2. The "English-Only" Problem</h3>
<p>The DPDPA (2023) requires you to give users the option to view the consent form in their native language (Schedule 8 languages).</p>
<p><strong>The Trap:</strong> Most free tiers from global tools only support English. Multi-language support is locked behind their "Premium" or "Enterprise" tiers.</p>
<p><strong>The Risk:</strong> If you show an English banner to a user in rural Maharashtra, you are technically violating the "Informed Consent" principle of the DPDPA.</p>

<h3>3. No "Consent Artifacts" (The Legal Black Hole)</h3>
<p>Under Indian law, if a user files a grievance, you must prove they gave consent.</p>
<p><strong>The Trap:</strong> Free tools usually just toggle a cookie on the browser. They don''t store a server-side log (Artifact) of the consent.</p>
<p><strong>The Risk:</strong> Without a timestamped, tamper-proof log, your "free" banner is useless in a legal audit.</p>

<h2>The Consently.in Difference: Honest Pricing</h2>

<h2>Why "Pay-As-You-Go" is Better Than "Free"</h2>
<p>With Consently, you pay ₹0.01 per consent.</p>

<h3>Scenario A: You are a new startup with 100 visitors this month.</h3>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> ₹1 (Virtually Free).</p>

<h3>Scenario B: You have a massive festive sale and get 50,000 visitors.</h3>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> ₹500.</p>
<p><strong>Competitor Cost:</strong> You''d be forced to upgrade to a $30 (₹2,500) monthly plan.</p>

<p>You only pay for value. If you have no traffic, you pay nothing. If you grow, your costs scale linearly, not exponentially.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: Don''t Build on Shaky Ground</h2>
<p>A "Free" consent manager that stops working when you get popular isn''t a tool; it''s a liability.</p>
<p>Choose a partner that gives you Enterprise-Grade DPDPA compliance (22 languages, artifacts, unlimited views) from Day 1, for the price of a cup of chai.</p>
<p><strong>Start for free. Scale with confidence.</strong></p>
