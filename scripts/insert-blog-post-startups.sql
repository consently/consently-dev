  '<h2>The Startup Dilemma: Growth vs. Compliance</h2>
<p>For an Indian startup founder, the to-do list is endless: PMF, hiring, fundraising, and shipping code. Compliance usually sits at the bottom of that list—until a VC asks for it during due diligence, or you receive a legal notice.</p>
<p>The Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023 has changed the game. It applies to everyone processing digital data in India. Whether you are a two-person team in a garage or a Series A fintech, if you collect user data, you are a "Data Fiduciary."</p>
<p>The problem? Most compliance tools in the market (like OneTrust or Securiti) are built for enterprises. They are complex, expensive, and require legal teams to manage.</p>
<p><strong>Startups don''t need enterprise bloat. They need Consently.in.</strong></p>

<h2>Why "Enterprise" Tools Fail Startups</h2>
<p>If you look at the legacy players, their model creates friction for agile teams:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Minimum commitments often start at $500–$1,000/month. That''s a junior developer''s salary!</li>
  <li><strong>Implementation Lag:</strong> It takes weeks of sales calls and integration. You need to ship today.</li>
  <li><strong>UX Friction:</strong> Clunky, legal-heavy banners kill your conversion rates and user onboarding flow.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How Consently.in is Built for the Startup Stack</h2>
<p>We built Consently.in specifically for the "Ship Fast" culture. Here is why it is the default choice for early-stage and growth-stage companies:</p>

<h3>1. Zero Burn Rate Impact (Pay-As-You-Grow)</h3>
<p>Startups need to protect their runway. We get it.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Competitors:</strong> High monthly retainers regardless of traffic.</li>
  <li><strong>Consently:</strong> You pay ₹0.01 per consent. If you have 100 users this month, you pay ₹1. If you scale to 100,000 users next month, we scale with you. No traffic? No bill.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Dev-First Integration (5 Minutes to Live)</h3>
<p>Your developers should be building features, not wrestling with compliance APIs. Consently integrates seamlessly with modern tech stacks (React, Next.js, Vue, or plain HTML).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Copy one script tag.</li>
  <li>Paste it into your &lt;head&gt;.</li>
  <li>You are compliant.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Investor-Ready Compliance</h3>
<p>When you are raising funds, VCs will check your data practices. "We have a cookie banner" isn''t enough anymore. You need Consent Artifacts. Consently automatically logs the who, when, and what of every consent given. When a VC asks, "Are you DPDPA compliant?" you can show them a dashboard of verifiable logs, not just a verbal "yes."</p>

<h3>4. Native Language Support for "Bharat" Users</h3>
<p>If your startup targets Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities (the "Next Billion Users"), English-only consent banners are legally risky and bad for UX. Consently supports 22 Indian languages. We detect your user''s preference and show the consent form in Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, or Marathi automatically. This builds trust and keeps you on the right side of the law.</p>

<h2>The "Set It and Forget It" Workflow</h2>
<p>We know you don''t want to think about compliance every day.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Sign up on Consently.in.</li>
  <li>Configure your policy links.</li>
  <li>Embed the code.</li>
  <li>Get back to building your product.</li>
</ol>
<p>Consently runs in the background, managing cookies, handling user withdrawals, and logging artifacts without slowing down your site.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>You wouldn''t buy SAP to manage your expenses when you are a 10-person team; you''d use Zoho or Quickbooks. Similarly, don''t buy enterprise compliance tools for your startup.</p>
<p>Get a solution that respects your runway and your developers'' time.</p>
